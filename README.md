# Pygame-NEAT-Ship

In this project, we used the NEAT algorithm to simulate ship movement in Pygame. We created a game environment where the ship moves around and optimized its movement using the NEAT algorithm. The simulation shows that the Ship has learned to move around the screen without going off the screen or getting stuck. The NEAT algorithm can be used for other simulations where evolution is a key factor in optimization.
